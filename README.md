# Unity Procedural Stochastic Texture Terrain Shader
Procedural Stochastic Texturing for Unity URP terrain, to fix repeated tile patterns on terrain textures.  

I'm trying to keep updated to lastest Unity/URP version, so if you use old Unity (with old URP version), check commits for old versions of this shader. My first release version was tested on Unity 2019.

From [rotoscope](https://www.reddit.com/user/rotoscope-/) adaptation, based on [Thomas Deliot and Eric Heitz paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QecekuuyWgw68HU9tg6ENfrCTCVIjm6l/view), implemented by me (Junior_Djjr) for Unity terrain lit shader with Universal Render Pipeline / URP.
